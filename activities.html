    <h2>Video Game Development</h2>
    <p>
      I am passionate about video game development, and I have been making games for almost eight years now. 
      I see creating video games as something almost magical: through lines of code and fleeting electricity running 
      through a computer, vivid emotions like joy and wonder come to life. The hope of inspiring these emotions in others 
      is what motivates me to continue on this path.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here are a few examples of games I have created in the past:
    </p>

    <h3>Birds With Guns</h3>

    <p>
      <em>Birds With Guns</em> is an im-peck-able roguelike shooter where two can play an egg-citing journey 
      to reclaim your eggs for the bird kingdom. Made by a team of quail-ified developers, 
      you're guaranteed to have no egrets.

    <p>
      Welcome to the Bugscraper. Rise to the top of this bug-filled skyscraper in a roguelike 
      shooter where you'll battle waves of enemies on every floor on your way to your boss's office.

    <h2>Drawing</h2>
    <p>
      I have always loved drawing, and I enjoy making my creations colorful and vibrant. Over the years, I have 
      experimented with many techniques and styles, but the one I have mastered the most is pixel art. 
      Here are some examples of my work:
    </p>

    <img src="assets/miniature_kaiju.png" alt="Pixel art - Miniature kaiju"/>

    <img src="assets/n7_pull_twitter.png" alt="Pixel art - N7 Pull"/>
