    <p>
      Before becoming a student at ENSEEIHT, I was enrolled in the 
      <a href="https://www.univ-tlse3.fr/decouvrir-nos-diplomes/licence-parcours-mathematiques-informatique-en-double-licence-midl">
        MIDL
      </a> 
      (Mathematics and Computer Science Double Bachelor's Degree) program at 
      <a href="https://www.univ-tlse3.fr">Toulouse University</a>. One of the subjects, called 
      "Devenir Étudiant" ("Becoming a Student"), encouraged us to interview professionals to learn more about their jobs 
      and required us to create a poster as a final project. Here is the poster we designed after interviewing various developers and teachers:
    </p>

    <p>
      This project taught me a lot about the realities of being a developer. Not only the technical
      aspects of the job, but also the importance of communication, collaboration, and passion 
      in the field.

    <p>
      As a 1st-year student in the Computer Science field at <a href="https://www.enseeiht.fr/">ENSEEIHT</a>, 
      here are the subjects I am currently following:</p>
    <p>
      <strong>
        1st Year SN – Semester 5 (each course unit is worth 5 ECTS credits)
        </strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Soft & Human Skills</li>
        <li>Integration and Applications – Probability</li>
        <li>Imperative Programming</li>
        <li>Numerical Analysis and Statistics</li>
        <li>Control Systems and Data Analysis</li>
        <li>Modeling and Architecture</li>
        <li>Support Unit</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>
        1st Year SN – Semester 6 (each course unit is worth 5 ECTS credits)
      </strong>

      <ul>

        <li>Object-Oriented Technology</li>
        <li>Architecture and Systems</li>
        <li>Support Unit</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope to choose the "Image & Multimedia" specialization next year. 
      I am looking forward to everything I will learn during my three years at ENSEEIHT, 
      and I hope that this experience will provide me with the skills and knowledge to 
      become a well-prepared engineer.
