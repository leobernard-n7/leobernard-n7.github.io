    <h1>Civic Engagement & Sustainability</h1>

    <p>
      Although I have not yet participated in a specific civic engagement project, I am very 
      interested in being involved in initiatives that have a positive social or environmental impact. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe that being an engineer also means taking responsibility for the world we live in, 
      and contributing to building a more sustainable and inclusive society.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the future, I would like to participate in local environmental projects, such as trash-collecting 
      initiatives organized by students, or engage myself to encourage more inclusion and diversity in 
      the programming fields. 
    </p> 
    <p>
      I would love to be able to use my skills in programming to have a positive impact on the
      world, a goal which is aligned with my wish to create positive emotions in people through
      digital arts.
